This repo currently just holds the start to a simulator for Forex backtesting... a more in depth readme can come later after things are more mature and organized.

## Setup
**Use the devcontainer**. Or if need be (mac):

```bash
brew install bazel buildifier googletest lcov nlohmann-json spdlog git-lfs

git lfs install # from repo folder
```
