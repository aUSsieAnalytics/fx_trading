This repo currently just holds the start to a simulator for Forex backtesting... a more in depth readme can come later after things are more mature and organized.

## Setup
**Use the devcontainer**. Or if need be:

```bash
brew install bazel
brew install buildifier
brew install googletest  # maybe not needed, idk if bazel will take of this
brew install lcov
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install # from repo folder
```
